# Overview
> This project has two parts. The first part is a web app that visualizes motor vehicle collision data from New York City using an interactive heatmap. The second part is a data analysis report that analyzes the motor vehicle collision data and provides insights into the data.

# Web App - NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions ([Link](https://nyc-motor-vehicle-collisions.netlify.app/))

## Introduction
This project aims to help students understand how to build a web app using real-world data from NYC Open Data through APIs. The web app visualizes motor vehicle collision data from New York City using an interactive heatmap. Users can filter the data based on specific criteria such as collisions involving pedestrians, cyclists, or motorists. By working on this project, students will gain practical experience in web development, API integration, and data visualization.

## Technology Used in this Project
The following technologies are used in this project:

* üòÄ **React.js:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* üòÑ **Mapbox GL JS:** A JavaScript library for rendering interactive maps using WebGL.
* üòÜ **react-map-gl:** A React wrapper for Mapbox GL JS that makes it easy to integrate Mapbox maps in a React application.
* üòâ **NYC Open Data API:** A public API provided by the city of New York that offers access to various datasets, including motor vehicle collision data.


## What Students Can Learn from this Project
By working on this project, students can learn:

* üê∏ **Web App Development:** Students will learn how to create a responsive and interactive web app using React.js, a widely used JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
API Integration: Students will learn how to fetch and process data from a real-world API (NYC Open Data API) and how to handle asynchronous operations in a React application.
* üê¢ **Data Visualization:** Students will learn how to visualize large datasets using interactive maps and heatmaps. They will use Mapbox GL JS and react-map-gl to create a rich, interactive map visualization of motor vehicle collisions.
* üêã **State Management and User Interaction:** Students will learn how to manage the state of a React application, create custom filters, and handle user interactions to update the map visualization.
* ü¶≠ **Performance Optimization:** Students will learn how to optimize the performance of a web app by managing data fetching, processing, and rendering efficiently.
By completing this project, students will gain a solid understanding of web app development, API integration, data visualization, and user interaction, preparing them for real-world software development projects.

# Data Analysis Report - NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions ([Colab Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hzTW5Y6RearAhev3Ywb9pTC22hq5CKfD/view?usp=sharing))

## Introduction
This data analysis project is designed to help students understand the process of conducting data analysis using real-world data from the New York City Open Data platform. By working with collision data, students will learn how to explore, clean, and visualize data to uncover interesting patterns and insights. This hands-on experience will provide students with valuable skills that can be applied to other datasets and industries.


## Technology Used in This Notebook
In this project, we leverage the following technologies and libraries to perform data analysis and visualization:

* **Python:** A versatile programming language widely used for data analysis.
* **Google Colab:** A cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment for writing, running, and sharing Python code.
* **Pandas:** A powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
* **Plotly:** An interactive, browser-based data visualization library for Python.
* **NYC Open Data API:** A public API provided by the City of New York, allowing access to a wide range of datasets related to city services and operations.

## Insights and Findings
In this data analysis notebook, we explore the New York City collision data and uncover various insights and findings. Some of the key findings include:

**üêô Temporal Analysis:** We analyze the data to understand the trends in the number of collisions, injuries, and fatalities over time. This helps us identify any patterns or seasonal fluctuations in the data.

**ü¶ã Borough-wise Analysis:** We investigate the number of collisions, injuries, and fatalities in different boroughs of New York City. This allows us to determine which areas have higher occurrences of collisions and may require more attention from authorities.

**ü¶ó Contributing Factors:** We explore the factors contributing to collisions in New York City, helping us identify the most common reasons behind these incidents. This information can be used to develop targeted interventions and policies to reduce collisions.

**üêû Vehicle Types Involved:** We examine the types of vehicles involved in collisions, which can provide insights into the role of different modes of transportation in traffic accidents.

**ü¶ü Collision Hotspots:** By visualizing the data on an interactive heatmap, we identify areas with higher concentrations of collisions, injuries, and fatalities. This information can help city planners and authorities prioritize interventions and allocate resources more effectively.

These findings provide valuable insights into the patterns and factors associated with collisions in New York City, contributing to a better understanding of traffic safety and potential areas for improvement.

## What Can Students Learn from This Project
By working on this project, students will learn:

* How to use APIs to obtain real-world data.
* Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques using Pandas.
